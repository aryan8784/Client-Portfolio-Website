                    <p class="mt-4  text-center">The client, a fintech company, approached me with a mission to simplify the process of spending, investing, and interacting with Africa. They wanted to provide a one-stop-shop for these activities, with a focus on convenience and access to Africa. They envisioned a multi-currency wallet that doubles as a local currency wallet, instant transfers, protection for medical bills, and the ability to purchase essentials for loved ones in Africa. They also planned to offer wealth building opportunities through partnerships and access to the African capital and goods market.
