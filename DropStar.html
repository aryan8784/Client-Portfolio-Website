                        clips onto live streams and online multiplayer games. They tasked us with developing the
                        software to operate the system and communicate with the hardware through the Internet of Things
                        (IoT).

                        multiplayer games. Additionally, the hardware and software needed to seamlessly communicate with
                        each other with zero latency.

                        client’s vision to life. Our design team crafted premium high-fidelity designs that kept to the
                        client’s core thesis of simplicity. Our development team built a top-tier product that
                        seamlessly integrated several APIs, including proprietary APIs, to enable users to search, trim,
                        and save their favorite clips. Furthermore, our development team architected an intelligent
                        algorithm to produce a recommendation engine based on what the user-base was currently
                        interested in. This algorithm was designed to solve user’s problems effectively and generate
                        revenue.
