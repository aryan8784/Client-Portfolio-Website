                <div>
                    <p class="mt-4  text-center">Our client, a member of the British equestrian community, approached
                        us with a unique vision for an interactive platform that would allow users to interact
                        with bridleways (horse-riding routes) on a map, as well as facilitate the buying and selling of
                        equestrian goods and services on a localized marketplace. Additionally, the client wanted to
                        create a social component for users to connect with others in the equestrian community.

                    <p class="mt-4  text-center">The client’s vision presented several challenges for our team to
                        overcome. One of the biggest challenges was engineering a map system that included bridleways,
                        which required gathering raw data from local authorities and building custom architecture from
                        scratch. Another challenge was integrating a payment infrastructure to support end-to-end
                        transactions for both goods and services. Lastly, our Design and Development Teams needed to
                        collaborate to design and build a smooth social feature to foster a vibrant community.

                <div>
                    <p class="mt-4  text-center">We have a unique 7-step process for building new products:
                        visioning, scoping, designing, developing, testing, launching and iterating. Using this process,
                        our Strategy Team gathered raw data from local authorities to build the interactive bridleways
                        map. Our Development Team used this data to build custom architecture from scratch. We
                        integrated a payment infrastructure to support end-to-end transactions for both goods and
                        services. Our Design and Development Teams collaborated to design and build a smooth social
                        feature to foster a vibrant community.

                <div>
                    <p class="mt-4  text-center">Despite these challenges, We were able to successfully launch the
                        platform across the UK, with over 4,000 sign-ups in the first two weeks. The interactive
                        bridleways map was a hit, as was the marketplace and community feature. Our inbuilt viral
                        referral mechanisms also contributed to the success of the launch. The client was thrilled with
                        the outcome, and our team is proud to have helped bring this unique vision to life.
