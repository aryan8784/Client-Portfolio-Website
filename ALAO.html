                    <p class="mt-4  text-center">Mobeen, a leading mobile app development company based in London, was
                        approached by a client with a vision to launch a new crowdfunding platform. The client wanted to
                        bring together early stage companies, influencers, and investors to create a community of owners
                        and drive growth through pre-existing marketing channels. However, they faced several challenges
                        in bringing their vision to life.

                        through the integration of brilliant products and coveted influencer marketing networks, offer
                        equity upside to influencers and investors, and support companies that have a positive impact on
                        their communities.

                        Firstly, the platform needed to be accessible to users across a range of devices, which meant
                        creating a full stack mobile app that was optimized for both iOS and Android. Additionally, the
                        team had to integrate a crowdfunding API that had been bespokely altered for the platform,
                        working closely with the development team behind the API from the USA.
